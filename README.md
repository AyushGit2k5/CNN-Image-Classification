# CNN_MLP-Image-Classification

## Problem
Built an image classification system to automatically classify Fashion-MNIST clothing images into six categories.

## Dataset
Fashion-MNIST dataset consisting of 28×28 grayscale clothing images across six classes.

## Approach
Implemented a baseline Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and an improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to capture spatial features.

## Evaluation
Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## Results
The CNN significantly outperformed the baseline MLP, achieving **96.7% accuracy** and higher F1-score.

## Future Improvements
Potential improvements include data augmentation, deeper CNN architectures, and hyperparameter tuning.
